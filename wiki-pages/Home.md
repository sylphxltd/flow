# Sylphx Flow - Development Flow & Agent Coordination Platform

A comprehensive platform that combines **development flow management** with **AI agent coordination** through persistent memory capabilities.

## 🚀 What Makes Sylphx Flow Special

**Sylphx Flow** solves two critical problems in modern development:

### 🧠 AI Agent Memory & Coordination
- **Persistent Memory**: AI agents remember and coordinate across sessions
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Works with Cursor, Kilocode, RooCode, and OpenCode  
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard Model Context Protocol for broad compatibility
- **Shared Context**: Multiple agents can collaborate through shared memory

### 📋 Development Flow Management
- **Type-Safe Guidelines**: Curated rules for modern web development
- **Consistent Code Generation**: Ensure quality across AI-generated code
- **Project Structure**: Standardized development patterns
- **Best Practices**: Built-in industry standards

## ✨ Core Features

| Feature | What It Does | Who Benefits |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **🧠 Memory System** | AI agents remember conversations and context | AI agents, developers |
| **🤖 Agent Coordination** | Multiple AI agents work together | Teams, complex projects |
| **📋 Development Rules** | Type-safe coding guidelines | Developers, code review |
| **🔧 CLI Management** | Full command-line control | DevOps, power users |
| **🌐 MCP Protocol** | Standard compatibility | All AI tools |

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Development Teams**
```bash
# Set up team-wide AI standards
npx github:sylphxltd/flow init

# Agents remember project context across sessions
npx github:sylphxltd/flow memory stats
```

### 2. **Solo Developers with AI**
```bash
# Your AI assistant remembers your project
npx github:sylphxltd/flow mcp start

# Coordinate between multiple AI tools
npx github:sylphxltd/flow mcp install --all
```

### 3. **Enterprise Integration**
```bash
# Deploy across multiple projects
npx github:sylphxltd/flow init --agent=cursor

# Manage AI memory at scale
npx github:sylphxltd/flow memory list --namespace="project"
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

**Get started in 60 seconds:**

```bash
# 1. Initialize your project
npx github:sylphxltd/flow init

# 2. Check what AI agents remember
npx github:sylphxltd/flow memory stats

# 3. Start the AI coordination server
npx github:sylphxltd/flow mcp start
```

That's it! Your AI agents now have persistent memory and follow consistent development guidelines.
