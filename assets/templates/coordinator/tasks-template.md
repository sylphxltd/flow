# Implementation Tasks: (Project name)

(Brief description of implementation approach and wave strategy)

## Wave Execution Strategy
(Organize tasks into sequential waves - each wave contains tasks that can execute in parallel with no conflicts. Example:)
- **Wave 1**: Foundation tasks - Execute in parallel, no dependencies
- **Wave 2**: Core features - Execute in parallel after Wave 1
- **Wave 3**: Integration - Execute in parallel after Wave 2

## Mandatory Per-Task Cleanup
**Before marking any task complete:**
1. Remove TODOs, console.log, debug code
2. Eliminate code duplication
3. Refactor for maintainability
4. Verify code standards compliance

## Wave 1: (Wave name - e.g., "Foundation Setup")

### TASK_1: (Task description - what needs to be implemented)
- [ ] **Implemented**: (Specific deliverable - e.g., "JWT middleware with token validation")
- [ ] **Cleanup Complete**: See mandatory checklist above
- **Assigned to**: (Specialist - e.g., backend-engineer)
- **Files Modified**: (Update after completion)
- **Notes**: (Decisions, issues, context)

### TASK_2: (Task description)
- [ ] **Implemented**: (Specific deliverable)
- [ ] **Cleanup Complete**: See mandatory checklist above
- **Assigned to**: (Specialist)
- **Files Modified**: 
- **Notes**: 

(Add more tasks as needed for Wave 1)

---

## Wave 2: (Wave name - e.g., "Core Features")

### TASK_X: (Task description)
- **Dependencies**: (Which Wave 1 tasks must complete first, or write "None")
- [ ] **Implemented**: (Specific deliverable)
- [ ] **Cleanup Complete**: See mandatory checklist above
- **Assigned to**: (Specialist)
- **Files Modified**: 
- **Notes**: 

(Add more tasks as needed for Wave 2)

---

## Wave 3: (Wave name - e.g., "Integration & Polish")

### TASK_Y: (Task description)
- **Dependencies**: (Which previous tasks must complete first, or write "None")
- [ ] **Implemented**: (Specific deliverable)
- [ ] **Cleanup Complete**: See mandatory checklist above
- **Assigned to**: (Specialist)
- **Files Modified**: 
- **Notes**: 

(Add more tasks and waves as needed)

---

## Task Modifications
(Document any tactical refinements made during Phase 6 - splits, reorders, merges, or write "None")

Example:
- **TASK_4 [REFINED]**: Split into 4a-4d (reason: too coarse for parallel execution)
- **TASK_7**: Reordered to Wave 2 (reason: dependency on TASK_3 discovered)

---

## Progress Summary
- **Wave 1**: __ / __ tasks done (both checkboxes per task)
- **Wave 2**: __ / __ tasks done
- **Wave 3**: __ / __ tasks done
- **Total**: __ / __ tasks complete

## Quick Reference
- **Current Wave**: (Which wave is currently executing)
- **Next Task**: (Next task to start)
- **Blockers**: (Any blockers preventing progress, or write "None")
