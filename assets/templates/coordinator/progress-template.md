# Progress: (Project name)

## Recovery Point
**Current Phase**: (Phase number and name - e.g., "Phase 3: Design")
**Next Action**: (Specific next step - e.g., "Delegate to planner for architecture consolidation")
**Branch**: (Git branch name - e.g., "feature/user-authentication")
**Workspace**: `specs/(project_type)/(project_name)/`

## Phase Status
| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1: Requirements | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Key decisions or issues, or write "None") |
| 2: Clarify & Research | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Research findings or clarifications, or write "None") |
| 3: Design | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Architecture decisions, or write "None") |
| 4: Task Breakdown | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Wave organization notes, or write "None") |
| 5: Validation | (pending/in_progress/complete/retry_1/retry_2) | (Validation status: PASS/MINOR/CRITICAL, or write "None") |
| 6: Implementation | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Current wave, task modifications, or write "None") |
| 7: QA | (pending/in_progress/complete/retry_1/retry_2) | (QA status: PASS/MINOR/CRITICAL, or write "None") |
| 8: Delivery | (pending/in_progress/complete) | (Merge status, or write "None") |

## Routing Decisions
(Document any phase returns due to CRITICAL_ISSUES - why returned and what was fixed, or write "None")

Example:
- **Phase 5 → Phase 3**: Design conflicts in API contracts, updated plan.md
- **Phase 7 → Phase 6**: Strategic task changes detected, returned to update spec.md

## Current Blockers
(List any blockers preventing progress, or write "None")

## Recovery Instructions
**If workflow interrupted, resume here:**

1. **Current Phase**: (Phase number and name)
2. **Next Action**: (Specific next step)
3. **Read relevant docs**:
   - Phase 1-2: `spec.md`
   - Phase 3: `plan.md`
   - Phase 4-6: `tasks.md`
   - Phase 5: `validation.md`
   - Phase 7-8: `reviews.md`
4. Check blockers above before continuing
5. Update this file after completing each phase
