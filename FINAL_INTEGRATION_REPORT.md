## Technical Implementation Details

### Effect Services Architecture

```typescript
// Service Layer Example - Memory Service
export const MemoryServiceLive = Layer.effect(MemoryService, makeMemoryService);

const makeMemoryService = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const sql = yield* SqlClient.SqlClient;
  
  return {
    set: (key: string, value: string, namespace = 'default') =>
      Effect.gen(function* {
        // Effect-based database operations with proper error handling
      }),
    get: (key: string, namespace = 'default') =>
      Effect.gen(function* {
        // Effect-based retrieval with typed results
      }),
    // ... other operations
  };
});
```

### Error Handling System

```typescript
// Tagged Errors for Type Safety
export class MemoryError extends Data.TaggedError('MemoryError')<{
  readonly message: string
  readonly operation: 'get' | 'set' | 'delete' | 'clear' | 'search' | 'stats'
  readonly key?: string
  readonly namespace?: string
  readonly cause?: unknown
}> {}
```

### Resource Management

```typescript
// Proper Resource Cleanup
const DatabaseLive = Layer.scoped(
  SqlClient.SqlClient,
  Effect.acquireRelease(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const client = yield* SqlClient.makeLibsqlClient({
        filename: config.dbPath
      });
      yield* initializeSchema(client);
      return client;
    }),
    (client) => Effect.promise(() => client.close())
  )
);
```
