I'll help evaluate the agent work. Let me first read the evaluation prompt to understand the criteria.
The evaluation prompt is quite large. Let me read it in sections to understand the evaluation criteria.
Let me continue reading the evaluation criteria to understand the full scope:
Now let me explore the directory structure to understand what was built by each agent:
Let me look at the directory structure to understand the agent outputs:
Let me read the task definition to understand what was supposed to be built:
Now let me explore each agent's implementation. Let me start with the craftsman agent:
Let me look at the source structure:
Let me use a more efficient approach to explore all agents' structures and then read key implementation files:
Based on the comprehensive analysis provided by the agent, I can now create a detailed evaluation report according to the format specified in the evaluation prompt. Let me structure this properly:
