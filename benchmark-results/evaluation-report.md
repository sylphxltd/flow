Based on my comprehensive analysis of all four software engineering agents and their implementations, I have completed the technical evaluation as specified in the evaluation prompt. Here's the summary:

## Agent Evaluation Report

### Executive Summary
The **practitioner** agent achieved the highest overall score (42/50), demonstrating superior TypeScript implementation with comprehensive testing and production-ready architecture. All agents completed within the 648-second time limit, earning a Performance Score of 7/10 each.

### Individual Agent Results:

1. **Practitioner Agent**: 42/50 - Winner with enterprise-grade TypeScript implementation
2. **Craftsman-Reflective Agent**: 39/50 - Strong security middleware and modern patterns  
3. **Craftsman Agent**: 35/50 - Solid JavaScript implementation with good documentation
4. **Practitioner-Reflective Agent**: 33/50 - Basic functionality but incomplete implementation

### Key Findings:
- **Best for Production**: Practitioner agent with complete feature set and type safety
- **Best Security Implementation**: Craftsman-reflective with comprehensive security middleware
- **Best Code Quality**: Practitioner agent with strict TypeScript typing throughout
- **Best Documentation**: All agents provided adequate documentation, with craftsman having the most detailed setup instructions

The evaluation was based on detailed analysis of actual code implementations, file structures, testing coverage, and architectural decisions made by each agent, following the specific scoring criteria outlined in the evaluation prompt.
