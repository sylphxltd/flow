# Validation: effect-ecosystem-migration

## Requirements Coverage
✅ All covered / ❌ Gaps:
- Phase 5: Requirement to replace @modelcontextprotocol/sdk conflicts with TASK_26 decision to keep MCP SDK (noted as serving different purposes)

## Design Consistency
✅ Consistent / ❌ Conflicts:
- Minor inconsistency between spec (replace MCP SDK) and implementation decision (keep MCP SDK)
- Progress shows Stages 2-5 complete but several tasks in those stages remain unchecked

## Task Completeness
✅ Complete / ❌ Missing:
- None - 50 comprehensive tasks covering all migration aspects

## TDD Strategy
✅ Adequate / ❌ Issues:
- Comprehensive testing strategy with Effect-specific patterns
- Clear coverage targets and test scenarios defined

**Status**: MINOR_ISSUES
**Summary**: Migration is well-planned with comprehensive task breakdown, but has minor inconsistencies in MCP SDK approach and task progress tracking.
**Action**: Clarify MCP SDK approach in spec and update progress tracking to reflect actual task completion status.
