# Specification: Effect Ecosystem Migration

## Objective
Migrate the entire project to the Effect ecosystem by replacing specified libraries and patterns with their Effect counterparts, ensuring modern, functional programming paradigms are adopted throughout the codebase.

## Requirements
Transform the user request into actionable requirements:
- Migrate custom error handling mechanisms to use Effect's built-in error handling (e.g., Effect.fail, pipe, etc.).
- Replace CLI implementation (currently using Commander) with @effect/cli for command-line interface management.
- Replace any MCP (assumed to be a specific module or pattern) usage with @effect/ai for AI-related operations.
- Integrate @effect/libsql for database interactions, replacing direct libsql usage.
- Update logging from console to @effect/log for structured logging.
- Refactor file system operations from native File APIs to @effect/platform.
- Convert all asynchronous operations to use Effect's Effect type for handling promises and concurrency.

No backward compatibility is required, allowing for a clean break from legacy implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All specified components (errors, CLI, MCP, libsql, console, File, Async) are fully migrated to their Effect equivalents.
- No remnants of original libraries (e.g., Commander, direct libsql calls) exist in the codebase.
- The refactored code remains fully functional, adhering to Effect's functional programming patterns (e.g., composition with pipe, error union types).
- If existing tests are present, all tests pass without modifications (or with minimal adaptations to fit Effect patterns).
- Dependencies are updated in package.json to include the new Effect libraries and remove obsolete ones.

## Success Metrics
- Achieve 100% migration coverage, verified by code scans for legacy library imports and patterns.
- All error handling in the codebase uses Effect's error primitives (e.g., no try-catch blocks remaining).
- All asynchronous operations are expressed using Effect types, ensuring proper resource management and error propagation.
- Post-migration, the application runs without runtime errors and maintains or improves performance.

## Project Scope
- Conduct a full refactor of the entire codebase, including source files, configurations, and utilities.
- Update project dependencies (package.json) to reflect new Effect ecosystem libraries.
- Adjust build configurations, TypeScript settings, and any related tooling to support Effect.
- Include documentation updates for the new patterns where applicable.

## Out of Scope
- Implementation of new features or enhancements beyond the migration.
- Performance optimizations unrelated to the Effect integration.
- Extensive testing additions; focus on ensuring existing tests pass.
