# Progress Tracking: effect-ecosystem-migration

## Current State
- **Phase**: Phase 6: Implementation (retry)
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
- **Overall Progress**: 60%

## Phase Status Tracker
| Phase | Status | Completion | Last Updated | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 1: Requirements Analysis | Completed | 100% | 2025-10-20 | Requirements fully analyzed and documented |
| 2: Clarify & Research | Completed | 100% | 2025-10-20 | Research completed, all dependencies clarified |
| 3: Design | Completed | 100% | 2025-10-20 | Architecture and task designs finalized |
| 4: Task Breakdown | Completed | 100% | 2025-10-20 | All tasks broken down into actionable steps |
| 5: Cross-Check & Validate | Completed | 100% | 2025-10-20 | Designs validated, no major issues |
| 6: Implementation | In Progress | 80% | 2025-10-20 | Partial implementation completed; retrying for fixes (deps, syntax, MCP/CLI integration) |
| 7: Testing & Review | Failed | 40% | 2025-10-20 | Failed due to test failures, coverage <95%, incomplete MCP/CLI migration, debug/TODO remnants, build issues. Root cause: Implementation bugs (deps/imports/syntax), partial task completion (MCP non-compliant). Routing back to Phase 6. Lessons learned: Earlier dep validation, full TDD enforcement per task. Estimated fixes: 4-6h. |
| 8: Merge | Not Started | 0% | 2025-10-20 | Awaiting successful Phase 7 |

## Current Blockers
| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Status | Resolution |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| Implementation Bugs (deps/imports/syntax) | High | Implementation Specialist | In Progress | Targeted fixes in Phase 6 retry |
| Incomplete MCP/CLI Migration | High | Implementation Specialist | In Progress | Complete integration during retry |
| Debug/TODO Remnants | Medium | Debug Specialist | Pending | Cleanup in Phase 6 |

## Next Actions
1. Fix dependencies and imports across affected modules
2. Resolve syntax errors and ensure MCP compliance
3. Clean up all debug statements and TODO comments
4. Complete MCP/CLI integration for remaining components
5. Re-run tests to achieve 95%+ coverage
6. Address build issues and proceed to Phase 7 re-attempt

## Recovery Instructions
**If resuming this project:**
1. **Current Phase**: Phase 6: Implementation (retry)
2. **Last Action**: Phase 7 failure documentation and routing (2025-10-20)
3. **Immediate Next**: Execute targeted fixes in Phase 6 as per Next Actions
4. **Execute these steps**:
   - [x] Review Phase 7 failure details
   - [x] Check current blockers
   - [ ] Execute Next Actions (fix deps, syntax, etc.)
   - [ ] Update this file after fixes
   - [ ] Re-attempt Phase 7 once fixes complete
   - [ ] Proceed to Phase 8 upon success

## Phase Transition Checklist
### Before Moving to Next Phase:
- [ ] All current phase tasks complete
- [x] Phase 7 failure documented with root causes and lessons
- [ ] Implementation fixes applied (deps, syntax, MCP/CLI, cleanup)
- [ ] Tests pass with >=95% coverage
- [ ] Build succeeds without issues
- [ ] Documentation updated for all changes
- [ ] No blocking issues remain
