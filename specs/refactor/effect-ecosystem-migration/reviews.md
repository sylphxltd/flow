# Phase 7 Consolidation Report: Effect Ecosystem Migration

## Executive Summary

This report consolidates the findings from Phase 7 of the Effect Ecosystem Migration refactor, integrating inputs from the tester, reviewer, and analyst. The migration aimed to transition the project's dependency ecosystem to a more modern and efficient structure, focusing on MCP, FS, and CLI components. Overall, the phase achieved partial success with significant progress in core implementation but failed quality gates due to incomplete requirements coverage, test failures, and lingering code quality issues.

Key highlights:
- **Progress**: 65% requirements mapped, 60% integration coverage.
- **Challenges**: Test coverage below 95%, debug artifacts remain, scope gaps in MCP/FS/CLI.
- **Next Steps**: Route to Phase 6 for remediation; re-run QA post-fixes.

Overall status: **FAIL** (due to test failures, incomplete MCP/CLI). Routing to Phase 6 for fixes on implementation bugs (deps/imports/syntax) and task gaps (MCP migration).

## Test Results

Tester executed 150 tests across 45 files, partial pass/fail, TDD compliance partial with gaps in waves.

### Passed/ Failed Files
- Passed: 30 files (unit: 85/100, integration: 20/30, E2E: 10/20)
- Failed: 15 files (MCP handlers, FS modules, CLI parser)

### Coverage Excerpt
Overall: 82% (<95% threshold).
- `/src/mcp/handlers.ts`: 65%
- `/src/fs/migration.ts`: 70%
- `/src/cli/parser.ts`: 60%

TDD: Partial (waves 1-2 ok, wave 3 gaps).

## Git Analysis

### Diff Stat
- Insertions: 1,250
- Deletions: 850
- Focus: MCP (8 files), FS (10), CLI (5)

## Requirements Validation

Analyst: 65% complete, gaps in MCP/FS/CLI.

| Req ID | Description | Status | Coverage % | Gaps |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|------|
| REQ-01 | MCP v2 migration | Partial | 70 | Import syntax errors |
| REQ-02 | FS effect compat | Partial | 60 | Async support missing |
| REQ-03 | CLI refactor | Fail | 50 | Build failures |
| REQ-04 | Backward compat | Pass | 100 | - |
| REQ-05 | Integration tests | Partial | 60 | Cross-layer gaps |
| REQ-06 | Docs updates | Pass | 100 | - |

Integration: 60%. QA: Fail (build/completeness).

## Quality Assessment

Score: 7/10.

- Bugs: 5 critical (MCP imports), 8 minor (FS syntax), 2 regressions (CLI timeouts)
- Issues: Test deps outdated, debug artifacts, scope gaps (legacy FS)

## TODO/Debug Detection

Grep: 30 files.
- TODO: 15 (e.g., MCP async)
- Debug: 8 console.log (e.g., CLI parsing)
- Other: 5 hardcoded paths

## Recommendations/Risks

### Recommendations
- Phase 6: Fix deps/imports/syntax; complete MCP gaps; remove debug.
- Testing: Full TDD re-run >95%.
- Integration: Add cross-layer tests.
- Cleanup: Grep TODO/debug.

### Risks
- High: MCP breaks prod effects.
- Medium: Coverage hides regressions.
- Low: Merge conflicts from diff.

## Overall Status and Routing
**FAIL** - Tests <95%, reqs <100%, code issues.

Routing to Phase 6 for bug/task fixes.
