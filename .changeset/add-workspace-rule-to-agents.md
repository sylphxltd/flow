"@sylphx/flow": patch
---

Add workspace.md rule to agent frontmatter:
- Coder: added workspace (creates .sylphx/ documentation)
- Reviewer: added workspace (checks workspace conventions)
- Writer: added workspace (documents .sylphx/ patterns)
- Orchestrator: kept core only (coordination, no file creation)

Ensures workspace documentation rule is properly embedded in Claude Code agent files.
