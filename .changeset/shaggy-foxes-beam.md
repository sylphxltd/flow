Refactor all prompts with research-backed MEP framework. Adds priority markers (P0/P1/P2), XML structure for complex instructions, concrete examples, and explicit verification criteria. Based on research showing underspecified prompts fail 2x more often and instruction hierarchy improves robustness by 63%. All prompts now pass "intern on first day" specificity test while remaining minimal.
