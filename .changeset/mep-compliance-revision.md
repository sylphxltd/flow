Revise completion reporting prompts for MEP compliance. Removed over-explanation, teaching language, and redundancy. Changed from prescriptive "what to include" lists to directive triggers. Reduced silent.md from 53 to 38 lines (-28%). Follows MEP principle: prompt (trigger behavior) not teach (explain rationale).
