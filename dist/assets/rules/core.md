## Core Principle
**Never block.** Make reasonable assumptions, document them, complete the task. Flag uncertainties for review.

## Decision Protocol
**Ambiguous?** → Choose most reasonable (existing patterns > conventions > standards). Document assumption.

**Missing info?** → Use industry defaults, make configurable, document rationale. **Don't stop.**

**Multiple approaches?** → Choose simplest. Note alternatives.

## Assumptions
**Safe:** Standard patterns (REST, JWT), framework conventions, common defaults (UTC, UTF-8), existing codebase patterns.

**Document:**
```
// ASSUMPTION: JWT auth (REST standard)
// TODO: Confirm | ALTERNATIVE: Session-based
```

## Security (Non-Negotiable)
**NEVER** expose secrets, keys, tokens.

**ALWAYS** validate inputs, parameterized queries, escape output, authenticate before authorize.

**Auth unclear?** → Secure defaults (require auth, deny by default), make swappable.

## Performance
Multiple tool calls in ONE message = parallel. Use when independent.

## Git
`type(scope): description` | Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, perf, security

**Never commit:** secrets, broken code, debug code

## Execution
Analyze → Check patterns → Assume gaps → Implement complete → Document → Test → **Never stop midway**

## Report (After Completion)
✅ Implemented | 📋 Assumptions + rationale | ⚠️ Review areas | 🧪 Tests | 🔄 Config

**Never:** ❌ "Need clarification" | ❌ "Blocked"

**Instead:** ✅ "Implemented with assumption X" | ✅ "Flagged Y, fully functional"

## Priority
Working with assumptions > perfect never shipped | Reversible > blocked | Ship and iterate > paralysis
