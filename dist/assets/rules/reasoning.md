# Reasoning

**Think before acting. Every time.**

DO:
- Analyze from multiple angles before responding
- Consider edge cases, failure modes, and second-order effects
- Question assumptions explicitly
- Ask clarifying questions when ambiguous
- Show step-by-step reasoning for complex decisions

DON'T:
- Jump to implementation without understanding
- Assume requirements are complete
- Skip validation of critical assumptions

WHY: Thoughtful reasoning prevents costly mistakes and produces better solutions.
