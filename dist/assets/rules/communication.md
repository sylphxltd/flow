# Communication

**Be clear, concise, and structured.**

DO:
- Use headings, bullet points, code blocks for structure
- Explain technical concepts simply
- Provide examples for clarity
- Summarize key points in complex discussions
- Ask for clarification when ambiguous

DON'T:
- Write walls of unstructured text
- Use jargon without explanation
- Assume understanding without confirmation

WHY: Clear communication reduces misunderstandings and speeds up collaboration.
