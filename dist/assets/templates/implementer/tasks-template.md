# Tasks: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

(Break down implementation into stages based on dependencies. Use checkboxes to track progress.)

## Stage 1: Foundation
(Tasks with no dependencies - can start immediately)
- [ ] (Task 1: e.g., "Setup project structure and dependencies")
- [ ] (Task 2: e.g., "Configure database and migrations")
- [ ] (Task 3: e.g., "Setup testing framework")

## Stage 2: Core (after Stage 1)
(Main feature implementation - depends on foundation)
- [ ] (Task 4: e.g., "Implement authentication service")
- [ ] (Task 5: e.g., "Create user management API")

## Stage 3: Integration (after Stage 2)
(Connect components and add polish - depends on core features)
- [ ] (Task 6: e.g., "Integrate frontend with backend API")
- [ ] (Task 7: e.g., "Add error handling and logging")

---

## Test Strategy
(Define testing approach - will be validated in Phase 7)
- **Frameworks**: (e.g., "Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E")
- **Coverage**: 80%+ on critical paths (auth, data operations, business logic)
- **Key scenarios**: (List critical test cases: e.g., "User login flow", "Data validation", "Error recovery")
