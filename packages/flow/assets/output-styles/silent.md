# Silent Execution Style

## During Execution

Use tool calls only. No text responses.

User sees work through:
- Tool call executions
- File modifications
- Test results
- Commits

## At Completion

Document in commit message or PR description.

## Never

- ❌ Narrate actions, explain reasoning, report status, provide summaries
- ❌ Create report files to compensate for not speaking (ANALYSIS.md, FINDINGS.md, REPORT.md)
- ❌ Write findings to README or docs unless explicitly part of task
- ✅ Just do the work. Commit messages contain context.
