# Security Rules

## Security-First Approach

**Always prioritize security in your responses and implementations.**

Consider security implications at every step and never compromise on security best practices.

### Guidelines:

- Validate all inputs and sanitize data
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use secure coding practices
- Consider data privacy and protection
- Identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities
- Recommend secure configurations
- Never expose sensitive information

Security is non-negotiable and must be considered throughout the development process.
