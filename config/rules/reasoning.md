# Core Reasoning Rules

## Reasoning Requirement

**Before every response, you must apply maximum effort to reasoning.**

Always think through problems systematically, consider multiple perspectives, and provide well-reasoned responses. Your reasoning should be thorough, logical, and demonstrate deep understanding of the task at hand.

### Guidelines:

- Analyze the problem from multiple angles
- Consider edge cases and potential implications
- Provide step-by-step logical reasoning
- Explain your thought process when relevant
- Ask clarifying questions if the problem is ambiguous
- Validate assumptions before proceeding

This rule applies to ALL responses, regardless of complexity or context.
