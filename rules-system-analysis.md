## 2. Rule Structure and Organization

### 2.1 File Format Standardization
**Front Matter Structure**:
```yaml
---
description: Development rules for [category]
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true
---
```

**Content Organization**:
- Hierarchical heading structure (##, ###, ####)
- Bulleted lists for specific rules
- Code examples for implementation guidance
- Rationale explanations for rule justification

### 2.2 Directory Structure

### 2.3 Rule Evolution Pattern
**Historical Progression**:
1. **Granular Specialization**: Originally split into technology-specific files
2. **Consolidation**: Merged related rules into comprehensive documents
3. **Modernization**: Updated with current best practices and technologies
4. **Standardization**: Unified front matter and formatting

## 3. Rule Enforcement and Application Mechanisms

### 3.1 Multi-Agent Compatibility System
**Supported AI Agents**:
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with YAML front matter
- **Kilocode**: `.kilocode/rules/*.md` without YAML front matter (flattened)
- **RooCode**: `.roo/rules/*.md` without YAML front matter (flattened)
- **OpenCode**: `.opencode/agent/*.md` for agent definitions

### 3.2 Automated Synchronization
**CLI Commands**:
```bash
# Sync rules to detected agent
flow sync

# Agent-specific sync
flow sync --agent=cursor
flow sync --agent=kilocode
flow sync --agent=roocode

# Preview changes
flow sync --dry-run

# Force overwrite
flow sync --force
```

**Sync Process**:
1. **Agent Detection**: Automatic detection based on existing directories
2. **Content Processing**: Format conversion based on agent requirements
3. **File Management**: Create/update/remove rule files
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars and detailed reporting

### 3.3 Content Transformation Logic
**Cursor Processing**:
- Preserves YAML front matter
- Maintains directory structure
- Adds descriptive metadata

**Kilocode/RooCode Processing**:
- Strips YAML front matter
- Flattens directory structure with prefix naming
- Converts to plain Markdown

### 3.4 Validation and Verification
**Built-in Validations**:
- File existence checks
- Content integrity verification
- Format compliance validation
- Agent compatibility verification

## 4. Integration with Development Workflow

### 4.1 Agent Coordination System
**Memory-Based Coordination**:
- Persistent memory storage for agent state
- Namespace-based organization
- Cross-agent communication through shared memory
- Workflow progress tracking

### 4.2 SDD (Structured Development & Delivery) Workflow
**7-Phase Process**:
1. **Constitution**: Project policies and standards
2. **Specify**: Detailed requirements with AC
3. **Clarify**: Ambiguity resolution
4. **Plan**: Architecture and implementation strategy
5. **Task**: Granular task breakdown
6. **Implement**: TDD-based execution
7. **Release**: Deployment preparation

### 4.3 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
**Memory Server Features**:
- JSON-based persistent storage
- CRUD operations for memory management
- Pattern-based search capabilities
- Namespace organization
- Statistics and monitoring

**Configuration Management**:
```jsonc
{
  "mcp": {
    "flow_memory": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "github:sylphxltd/flow", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Initialize project with rules and agents
flow init

# Sync development rules
flow sync

# Install agent definitions
