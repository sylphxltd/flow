# Content Style Guide

Voice & Tone
- Friendly, concise, professional. Prefer plain US English.
- Use sentence case for headings and buttons (e.g., "Download invoice").
- Avoid jargon; explain technical terms on first use.

Microcopy Patterns
- Primary CTA: imperative and specific ("Top up wallet", "Start subscription").
- Secondary: supportive ("Learn more", "View details").
- Empty states: brief problem + clear next action.
- Confirmation: "Done" + short summary.

Errors & Help
- Error messages: human, action-oriented, include next step.
  - Bad: "Error 400"
  - Good: "Card was declined. Try another card or contact your bank."
- Field help text under inputs; show validation messages inline.

Numbers, Dates, Currency
- Currency: USD, format like "$12.34" (always include symbol and 2 decimals).
- Dates: ISO-like in UI "2025-09-25" or locale-aware "Sep 25, 2025"; avoid ambiguous numeric dates.
- Time zones: show user-local time with TZ when relevant.

Capitalization & Punctuation
- Sentence case for UI; Title Case only for proper nouns.
- Avoid exclamation marks; keep punctuation minimal.

Links & References
- Use descriptive link text ("View Privacy Policy") not "click here".
- For destructive actions, include a short confirmation explanation.

Consistency
- Use consistent naming across app, docs, and emails (e.g., "Wallet", not "Balance" in one place and "Credits" in another).
