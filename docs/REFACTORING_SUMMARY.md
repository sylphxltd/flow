# CLI Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The CLI structure has been successfully refactored to improve modularity, reduce code duplication, and enhance maintainability.

## New Structure

### Core Files
- `src/cli.ts` - Main CLI application setup and configuration
- `src/types.ts` - Type definitions for commands and options
- `index.ts` - Simplified entry point

### Utilities
- `src/utils/error-handler.ts` - Centralized error handling with custom CLIError class
- `src/utils/command-builder.ts` - Reusable command creation utilities
- `src/utils/help.ts` - Help text management

### Command Modules
- `src/commands/sync.ts` - Sync command configuration and validation
- `src/commands/install.ts` - Install command configuration and validation  
- `src/commands/mcp.ts` - MCP server command configuration

## Key Improvements

### 1. Modularity
- Commands are now separated into individual modules
- Common utilities are extracted and reusable
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Reduced Code Duplication
- Common options defined once in `command-builder.ts`
- Error handling centralized and consistent
- Command creation pattern standardized

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Custom `CLIError` class with error codes
- Consistent error formatting and context
- Proper error propagation and exit codes

### 4. Type Safety
- Strong typing for command options and configurations
- Interface-based command definitions
- Better TypeScript integration

### 5. Maintainability
- Easy to add new commands following the established pattern
- Centralized configuration for common options
- Clear file organization and naming

## Usage Examples

The refactored CLI maintains the same interface:

```bash
rules sync --agent cursor --dry-run
rules install --agent opencode
rules mcp
```

## Testing Results

✅ CLI help functionality working
✅ Individual command help working  
✅ Error handling with validation working
✅ Command structure and options preserved

## Notes

- The existing `sync.ts` and `install.ts` files have some TypeScript errors that were present before the refactoring
- The new modular structure is fully functional and tested
- All CLI functionality has been preserved while improving the codebase structure
