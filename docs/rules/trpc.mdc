# tRPC Rules

## 🏗️ API Structure
- Define procedures with proper input/output types
- Use routers for logical grouping
- Implement middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Proper error handling and status codes

## 🔒 Type Safety
- End-to-end type safety between client and server
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Proper TypeScript inference
- No manual API contracts

## 🚫 Forbidden with tRPC
- REST API endpoints (use tRPC procedures)
- Manual HTTP client calls (use tRPC client)
- Missing input validation
- Inconsistent error handling

## 🎯 Best Practices
- Batch multiple queries when possible
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use subscriptions for real-time features
- Subscriptions implement cursor-based replay
- Proper error boundaries for failed requests

## 🔗 Integration Patterns
- Server Components for initial data loading
- Client Components with tRPC hooks
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Loading states and error handling

## 🔄 Links & Subscriptions
- Use `httpBatchLink` for queries/mutations
- Use `wsLink` for subscriptions (auto-reconnect enabled)
- Client resends last cursor on reconnect
- Server replays missing events via Redis
- Redis as event bus for multi-instance fanout
