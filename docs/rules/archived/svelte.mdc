# Svelte

   - Only use Runes API; legacy `$:` reactive statements are forbidden.
   - Side effects must be handled inside `$effect`.
   - Always clean up resources and event listeners using the `$effect` return function.
   - Manage client state with `$state` and `$derived`; avoid module-level mutable singletons.
