# Smart Orchestrator Design Document

## Overview

This document describes the design philosophy, anticipated problems, and solution approaches for the Smart Orchestrator.

## Core Problem Analysis

### 1. Original Issues Identified
- **Poor Quality Outputs**: Results contain errors, incomplete migrations, garbage documentation
- **Black Box Planning**: No visibility into orchestrator's planning process
- **Lack of Self-Review**: No built-in quality control mechanisms
- **Rigid Delegation**: Over-specified task templates limit LLM autonomy
- **Garbage Generation**: Unnecessary example docs, poor cleanup practices

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- **Control vs Autonomy Balance**: Too much micro-management, too little trust
- **Task vs Goal Orientation**: Focus on completing tasks rather than achieving best outcomes
- **Missing Review Culture**: No automatic self-review loops built into workflow
- **Template Rigidity**: Structured templates inhibit creative problem-solving

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Self-Reviewing First**: Every major decision must be reviewed by another specialist
2. **Goal-Oriented Delegation**: Provide objectives, not detailed instructions
3. **Trust-Based Autonomy**: Give LLMs freedom to make professional judgments
4. **Quality Over Speed**: Better outcomes are more important than faster completion
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in loops for self-correction

### Decision Making Framework

#### When to Use Parallel vs Sequential
**Logic**: The fundamental question is "What creates real value?"

**Parallel When**:
- Tasks are truly independent (no shared files, no dependencies)
- Parallel execution saves significant time (>30% improvement)
- Tasks have similar complexity levels
- All tasks can use the same context/inputs

**Sequential When**:
- Tasks share dependencies
- One task's output is needed by another
- Complexity outweighs time savings
- Dependencies create bottlenecks

**Rationale**: LLMs don't have human coordination limitations. The only real constraints are logical dependencies and actual value creation.

#### Self-Review Decision Points
**Mandatory Reviews**:
1. **Planning Review**: After creating implementation plan, before execution
2. **Implementation Review**: After major code changes, before testing
3. **Completeness Review**: Before final delivery
4. **Quality Review**: Before declaring work complete
5. **Cleanup Review**: Final check for unnecessary outputs

**Rationale**: LLMs are capable of self-critique but need structured mechanisms to ensure it happens consistently.

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Higher-Level Delegation

#### Old Approach (Problematic):
```
**TO**: coder
**TASK**: Implement user authentication with JWT tokens
**CONTEXT**: [detailed instructions]
**DELIVERABLES**: [specific files]
**DEPENDENCIES**: [explicit dependencies]
```

#### New Approach (Goal-Oriented):
```
**GOAL**: Implement secure user authentication system
**CONTEXT**:
- Project needs modern authentication
- Security standards require JWT with refresh tokens
- Performance target: <200ms response time
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- Users can register, login, logout
- Tokens expire and refresh correctly
- No security vulnerabilities
- Performance targets met
**DECISION AUTHORITY**:
- Choose specific implementation approach
- Make architectural decisions within security guidelines
- Define file structure
```

**Rationale**: LLMs are intelligent agents that can figure out the "how" if given clear "what" and "why". This leverages their problem-solving capabilities rather than constraining them.

### 2. Built-in Self-Reviewing Loops

#### Planning Phase Self-Review:
```
1. Orchestrator creates initial plan
2. Orchestrator automatically assigns plan to reviewer:
   "Review this migration plan for completeness:
   - Are all files identified?
   - Are dependencies correctly mapped?
   - Are success criteria clear?
   - What's missing?"
3. Reviewer provides feedback
4. Orchestrator refines plan based on feedback
5. Repeat until reviewer approves plan
```

#### Implementation Phase Self-Review:
```
1. Coder completes implementation
2. Orchestrator automatically assigns to reviewer:
   "Review this implementation:
   - Does it meet requirements?
   - Are there any obvious bugs?
   - Is the code quality acceptable?
   - What needs improvement?"
3. Reviewer provides specific feedback
4. Coder addresses feedback
5. Repeat until approved
```

**Rationale**: This creates a quality-first culture where no work proceeds without validation. The orchestrator takes responsibility for ensuring quality.

### 3. Output Quality Control

#### Built-in Quality Questions:
For every output, orchestrator must ask:
- "Is this documentation actually useful to users?"
- "Are these examples necessary or just noise?"
- "Could this be simplified or eliminated?"
- "Does this improve the codebase or just add clutter?"

#### Automatic Cleanup Process:
```
After completing main work:
1. Review all generated files
2. Ask: "Is this file necessary and valuable?"
3. Remove unnecessary files
4. Consolidate redundant documentation
5. Ensure clean, minimal final state
```

**Rationale**: LLMs tend to generate comprehensive but often excessive outputs. Built-in quality control prevents accumulation of useless artifacts.

### 4. Migration-Specific Safeguards

#### Migration Completeness Framework:
```
For any migration task:
1. **Inventory Phase**: List all items that need migration
2. **Mapping Phase**: Define how each item will be migrated
3. **Verification Phase**: Test each migrated item
4. **Regression Test**: Ensure nothing is broken
5. **Cleanup Phase**: Remove old patterns
```

#### Built-in Migration Questions:
- "What haven't I migrated yet?"
- "How can I verify this migration is complete?"
- "Are there any remaining references to old patterns?"
- "Have I tested the migrated functionality?"

**Rationale**: Migrations are particularly prone to incompleteness. Specific safeguards prevent half-finished migrations.

## Anticipated Problems & Solutions
