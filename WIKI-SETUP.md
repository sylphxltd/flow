# Wiki Setup Instructions

## 📚 Created Wiki Pages

The following wiki pages have been created in `./wiki-pages/`:

### Core Pages
- **Home.md** - Main wiki landing page with navigation
- **Installation-&-Setup.md** - Complete installation and configuration guide
- **Memory-System.md** - Detailed memory management documentation
- **CLI-Commands.md** - Complete command reference

## 🚀 Publishing to GitHub Wiki

### Step 1: Access Wiki
1. Go to https://github.com/sylphxltd/flow
2. Click the "Wiki" tab (near the top)
3. If wiki doesn't exist yet, click "Create the first page"

### Step 2: Create Home Page
1. Page title: `Home`
2. Copy content from `wiki-pages/Home.md`
3. Save the page

### Step 3: Create Additional Pages
For each remaining file:

1. Click "Add Page" 
2. Page title (use exact filename without .md):
   - `Installation & Setup`
   - `Memory System`
   - `CLI Commands`
3. Copy content from corresponding file in `wiki-pages/`
4. Save each page

### Step 4: Verify Navigation
- Check that all pages are listed in the sidebar
- Test internal links between pages
- Verify formatting looks correct

## 🔗 Internal Links

All internal links use the format `[[Page Name]]` which GitHub wiki automatically converts to proper links.

## 📝 Notes

- The Home.md page should be created first as it serves as the main navigation
- Page titles in GitHub wiki should match the filenames (without .md extension)
- Internal links will work once all pages are created
- Images and attachments can be added later if needed

- [ ] All pages are accessible from the wiki sidebar
- [ ] Internal links work correctly
