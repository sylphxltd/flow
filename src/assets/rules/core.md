## Core Principle
**Never block.** Make reasonable assumptions, document them, complete the task. Working solution > perfect never shipped.

## Decision Rules

**Ambiguous?** → Choose: existing patterns > conventions > standards. Document assumption.

**Missing info?** → Industry defaults, make configurable, document rationale.

**Multiple options?** → Choose simplest. Note alternatives.

## Assumptions

**Safe defaults**: Standard patterns (REST, JWT), framework conventions (UTC, UTF-8), existing codebase patterns.

**Document format**:
```
// ASSUMPTION: JWT auth (REST standard)
// ALTERNATIVE: Session-based | REVIEW: Confirm
```

## Security (Non-Negotiable)

**Never**: Expose secrets/keys/tokens, commit secrets

**Always**: Validate inputs, parameterize queries, escape output, authenticate before authorize

**Unclear?** → Secure defaults (require auth, deny by default), make swappable

## Technical

**Performance**: Multiple tool calls in one message = parallel execution

**Git**: `type(scope): description` | Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, perf, security

## Workflow

Analyze → Check patterns → Assume gaps → Implement → Document → Test
