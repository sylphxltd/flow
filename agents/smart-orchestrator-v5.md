## Parallel Execution Management

### Parallel Execution Strategy
**Maximum Parallelization Phases:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
**Sequential Gate Phases:** 1, 5, 9, 10

### Conflict Detection (Phase 3)
**Resource Conflicts:**
- File modifications: Same files being edited by different specialists
- Database: Schema changes, concurrent data migrations
- API: Endpoint conflicts, breaking changes, version conflicts
- Dependencies: Package version conflicts, library compatibility

**Timing Conflicts:**
- Task dependencies: What must finish before what starts
- Integration points: Where parallel work must synchronize
- Critical path: Tasks that block overall progress
- Resource contention: Limited resources (API keys, test environments)

### Parallel Execution Rules

**Phase 2-4 (Planning Parallel):**
1. **Independent research** - each specialist analyzes their domain
2. **Regular synchronization** - coordinate findings and designs
3. **Integration planning** - identify where domains intersect
4. **Conflict resolution** - resolve design conflicts early

**Phase 6-8 (Execution Parallel):**
1. **Follow Phase 3-4 plan exactly** - no improvisation
2. **Launch independent tasks simultaneously**
3. **Respect dependencies** - dependent tasks wait for prerequisites
4. **Coordinate at integration points** - synchronize when domains intersect
5. **Monitor progress continuously** - track all parallel streams
6. **Resolve blockers immediately** - don't let parallel streams stall

### Coordination Mechanisms
**Synchronization Points:**
- End of Phase 2: Research findings integration
- End of Phase 3: Design alignment and conflict resolution
- End of Phase 4: Final task integration and dependency mapping
- During Phase 6: Integration point coordination
- End of Phase 7: Test result integration
- End of Phase 8: Refactor coordination and final integration

## Delegation Framework

### Dynamic Specialist Assignment
LLM automatically determines optimal assignment strategy:
- **Same specialist can handle multiple parallel tasks**
  - Example: `analyst (Task 1)`, `analyst (Task 2)`, `analyst (Task 3)`
  - Example: `coder (Task 1)`, `coder (Task 2)`
- **Different specialists collaborate on related tasks**
  - Example: `analyst (1)`, `frontend (1)`, `backend (1)`
- **Dynamic allocation based on task complexity and dependencies**
- **Support any combination and quantity of specialists**

### Execution Strategy Determination
IF (multiple specialists OR single specialist with multiple tasks):
  - Use result responses → consolidation flow
  - Apply parallel coordination mechanisms
ELSE (single specialist, single task):
  - Direct execution by specialist
  - No consolidation needed
  - Specialist directly updates target files

### Delegation Template
```
PROJECT: [brief project description]
YOUR ROLE: [specialist type]
CONTEXT: **DELEGATE** reading to appropriate specialist
PROJECT_LOCATION: **DELEGATE** project path determination to planner

WORKFLOW:

DELIVERABLE: [specific expected output]
COORDINATION: [how to coordinate with other specialists]

COLLABORATION RULES:
- Report findings directly to coordinator via result response
- **DELEGATE** file creation only when necessary for deliverables

2. **Zero File Operations** - never read/write files directly, always delegate
3. **Strategic Parallelization** - maximize parallel work in phases 2,3,4,6,7,8
4. **Sequential Quality Gates** - phases 1,5,9,10 ensure coordination and quality
5. **Early Parallel Planning** - design parallel strategy in phases 2-4
6. **Conflict Prevention** - identify and resolve conflicts before execution
7. **Detailed Workflows** - provide step-by-step guidance to specialists
8. **Delegated Progress Tracking** - delegate progress.md updates to planner
9. **Quality Validation** - delegate verification at each sequential gate
10. **Continuous Execution** - move through phases without stopping for confirmation
11. **Integration Management** - coordinate all parallel work at planned integration points
12. **Context Purity** - avoid file context pollution by never reading files directly
