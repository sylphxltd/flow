# Clarified Requirements: SDD Specification Process

## Resolved Clarifications
- Q: Does a spec.md file exist for clarification? → A: No spec.md file found in the project. The SDD specification process appears to be set up but not yet executed.

## Applied Updates (Audit log; no duplication)
- Section: Initial Assessment
  - Changed: "No specification document found for clarification"
  - Reason: SDD process setup is complete but specification creation has not been initiated
  - Spec Reference: N/A (no spec.md exists)

## Specification Clarification Analysis

### Current State Assessment
- **Status**: "Blocked - Missing Specification"
- **Issue**: No spec.md file exists to clarify
- **Root Cause**: SDD specification process has not been executed yet

### Required Actions Before Clarification
1. **Execute SDD-Specify Mode**: The specification creation process must be completed first
2. **Create Initial Specification**: A spec.md file must be generated with user stories, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. **Establish Context**: User task and project context must be provided to the specification process

### SDD Process Dependencies
- **Missing Inputs**: User task, spec_workspace, git_branch, track parameters
- **Required Artifacts**: spec.md (must be created before clarification can proceed)
- **Process Flow**: SDD-Specify → SDD-Clarify → SDD-Plan → SDD-Implement

### Clarification Readiness Checklist
- [ ] spec.md file exists with mandatory sections
- [ ] User Stories with Acceptance Criteria defined
- [ ] Functional Requirements (FR-xxx) documented
- [ ] Success Criteria (SC-xxx) established
- [ ] ≤3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- [ ] Git branch created and committed

## Standardized Report Format (completion report)

---
**Execution Summary**:
- What was done: Assessed current SDD process state and identified missing specification document
- Key decisions made: Determined that clarification cannot proceed without specification creation
- Rationale: SDD clarification process requires an existing specification document to analyze

**Files**:
- clarify.md (created, assessment of current state)
- Branch: main (current working branch)

**Clarification Analysis**:
- Dimensions evaluated: 10 (assessment mode)
- Ambiguities identified: 0 (no specification to clarify)
- Ambiguities resolved: 0
- Resolution methods: Self-assessment only
- Questions asked: 0

**Quality Assessment**:
- Spec clarity improvement: N/A (no specification exists)
- Remaining risks: 1 (missing specification document)
- Scope impact: No changes (process clarification only)

**State Transition**:
- Previous state: N/A (initial assessment)
- Current state: "Blocked - Missing Specification"
- Reason: SDD specification process has not been executed

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Must execute SDD-Specify mode to create spec.md first
- User task input required for specification creation
- Git branch creation required for proper version control

**Potential Risks**:
- SDD process cannot proceed without specification document
- User context missing for proper specification creation
- Version control tracking not established

**Evidence References**:
- clarify.md (current state assessment)
- SDD agent files reviewed for process understanding
- Git status checked for branch information

**Status**: "Blocked - Missing Specification"

## Error Handling
- **Missing specification**: Status = "Blocked - Missing Specification: Execute SDD-Specify mode first"
- **Process dependency**: Status = "Blocked - Process Dependency: Complete SDD-Specify before SDD-Clarify"
- **User input required**: Status = "Blocked - User Input Required: Provide task context for specification creation"

## Next Steps Recommendation
1. Execute SDD-Specify mode with appropriate user task input
2. Create spec.md file with complete specification content
3. Return to SDD-Clarify mode once specification exists
4. Proceed with clarification of any ambiguities found in the specification
