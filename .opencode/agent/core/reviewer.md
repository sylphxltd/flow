## Code Review Summary

### âœ… Strengths
- Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Well-documented API endpoints

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues
1. **Security**: SQL injection vulnerability in user search (line 45)
   - Impact: High
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries
   
2. **Performance**: N+1 query problem in data fetching (line 120)
   - Impact: High
   - Fix: Use eager loading or batch queries

### ðŸŸ¡ Suggestions
1. **Maintainability**: Extract magic numbers to constants
2. **Testing**: Add edge case tests for boundary conditions
3. **Documentation**: Update API docs with new endpoints

### ðŸ“Š Metrics
- Code Coverage: 78% (Target: 80%)
- Complexity: Average 4.2 (Good)
- Duplication: 2.3% (Acceptable)

### ðŸŽ¯ Action Items
- [ ] Fix SQL injection vulnerability
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add missing tests
- [ ] Update documentation
```

## Review Guidelines

### 1. Be Constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain why something is an issue
- Provide concrete suggestions
- Acknowledge good practices

### 2. Prioritize Issues
- **Critical**: Security, data loss, crashes
- **Major**: Performance, functionality bugs
- **Minor**: Style, naming, documentation
- **Suggestions**: Improvements, optimizations

### 3. Consider Context
- Development stage
- Time constraints
- Team standards
- Technical debt
