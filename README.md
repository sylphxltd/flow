## The Problem With AI Coding Today

**Traditional AI coding tools make you work too hard:**

```typescript
// What you have to type today ❌
User: "I'm using TypeScript + React + Next.js 14 App Router,
      project structure is src/app for routes,
      src/components for components,
      using shadcn/ui for UI, Tailwind for styling,
      Zod for validation, tRPC for API,
      current time is 2025-10-30,
      system is macOS on Apple Silicon,

      I want to implement user authentication with:
      - JWT tokens with 1hr expiry
      - Refresh token mechanism
      - Secure httpOnly cookies
      - RBAC with roles: user, admin
      - Rate limiting on login endpoint
      - Password hashing with bcrypt
      - Email verification flow

      Please follow our existing code patterns,
      make it type-safe with TypeScript,
      add comprehensive error handling,
      include unit tests with Vitest,
      and document the API endpoints..."

// You get: Maybe correct code, maybe not 🤷
```

**This is insane. You spend more time writing prompts than code.**

---

## The Sylphx Flow Solution

```bash
# What you type with Sylphx Flow ✅
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run "implement authentication"

# You get: Production-ready code that:
✅ Uses YOUR tech stack (auto-detected)
✅ Follows YOUR patterns (from codebase)
✅ Applies best practices (from knowledge base)
✅ Knows current time and environment
✅ Is properly tested and documented
```

**90% less prompt. 100% better code.**

---

## 🚀 Two Commands. That's It.

### 1. Setup (Once)

```bash
npx github:sylphxltd/flow init
```

Done. Everything configured. Never think about setup again.

### 2. Build (Forever)

```bash
# Direct prompt
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run "add password reset"
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run "review for security" --agent reviewer
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run "write API docs" --agent writer

# Or interactive mode - just start chatting
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run
> implement OAuth
> add tests
> optimize performance
```

**That's literally it.** No configuration files. No prompt engineering. No context management.

---

## 🌟 Core Innovations

### 1. MEP (Minimal Effective Prompt) Architecture

**The Philosophy:** AI should adapt to you, not the other way around.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Traditional Approach** ❌
```
You: [500 words of context]
AI: [50% accurate code]
You: [200 words of corrections]
AI: [70% accurate code]
You: [100 words more...]
```

</td>
<td width="50%">

**MEP Approach** ✅
```
You: "implement feature X"
AI: [Gets all context automatically]
AI: [95% accurate code]
You: [Ship it]
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**How?** AI automatically accesses:
- 🔍 Your codebase patterns (via semantic search)
- 📚 Best practices (via curated knowledge)
- 🖥️ Your environment (via system hooks)
- ⏰ Current time and context (automatic)

### 2. StarCoder2 Tokenization - 70+ Languages

**First production platform to use StarCoder2 tokenization for code search.**

```bash
# Search in ANY language, find code in ANY language
$ flow codebase search "user authentication logic"  # English
$ flow codebase search "處理用戶登入嘅邏輯"         # Chinese
$ flow codebase search "ユーザーログイン処理"       # Japanese

# All return the SAME results:
✅ authenticateUser() in TypeScript
✅ authenticate_user() in Python
✅ AuthenticateUser() in Go
✅ Even with totally different naming!
```

**Why this matters:**
- Find code by what it **does**, not what it's **called**
- Works across 70+ programming languages
- Understands natural language in any human language
- Semantic tokenization, not keyword matching
- TF-IDF search powered by world-class tokenization

### 3. Curated Knowledge Base (No Maintenance)

**We don't let you add custom knowledge. Here's why:**

| Curated (Sylphx Flow) | Custom (Others) |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| ✅ Professionally maintained | ❌ You maintain it |
| ✅ Always up-to-date | ❌ Gets outdated |
| ✅ Quality guaranteed | ❌ Quality varies |
| ✅ <100ms search | ❌ Slower, variable |
| ✅ Zero cognitive load | ❌ "Which guide to use?" |

**"But I need project-specific patterns!"**
→ Use codebase search. Your patterns are already in your code.

### 4. Functional Architecture

**Built with pure functional programming principles:**

- 🧩 **Composition over Inheritance** - Tools compose naturally
- 🎯 **Pure Functions** - Predictable, testable, parallel
- 🔒 **Immutable Data** - No side effects, easier debugging
- 🌊 **Pipeline Architecture** - Natural data flow

```typescript
// Agents compose like functions
const result = await pipe(
  knowledge_search("auth patterns"),
  codebase_search("auth implementation"),
  synthesize
)("implement OAuth");
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Install & Setup

```bash
# 1. Initialize (one time)
npx github:sylphxltd/flow init

# 2. (Optional) Set OpenAI-compatible API key to use vector search
# Without key: Uses TF-IDF search (fast, free)
# With key: Auto-upgrades to vector search (higher quality)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Auto-switches search mode
```

### Start Building

```bash
# Method 1: Direct command
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run "implement user registration"

# Method 2: Interactive mode (recommended)
npx github:sylphxltd/flow run
# Then just chat naturally:
# > add authentication
# > review the code
# > add tests
# > optimize performance
```

**That's it. Start building.**

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Implement Feature (90% Less Typing)

<table>
<tr><th>Traditional</th><th>Sylphx Flow</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
# 5 minutes of typing...
"I need a user profile page
with Next.js 14 App Router,
using TypeScript, shadcn/ui,
Tailwind CSS, tRPC for API,
Zod for validation...

Display user info, allow editing,
validate forms, show loading states,
handle errors, use server components
where possible, client components
when needed, follow our patterns
in src/app/(dashboard)/settings..."

# 😫 Still probably missing something
```

</td>
<td>

```bash
flow run "user profile page"
```

**10 seconds.**
AI already knows:
- Your tech stack
- Your patterns
- Your structure
- Best practices

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Example 2: Code Review (Smart & Fast)

<table>
<tr><th>Traditional</th><th>Sylphx Flow</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
"Review this auth code for:
- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Password security
- Token expiry
- Error handling
- Type safety
- Performance issues
- Best practices
- Code style
- Test coverage..."

# 😵 Did I forget anything?
```

</td>
<td>

```bash
flow run "review for security" \
  --agent reviewer
```

Reviewer agent automatically checks:
- All security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices
- Your code style
- Everything

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Example 3: Multi-Language Codebase

```bash
# Your team uses multiple languages
# TypeScript frontend + Python backend + Go services

# Traditional tools: Struggle with context switching
# Sylphx Flow: Understands ALL of them

$ flow codebase search "authentication middleware"

# Finds authentication code in:
✅ TypeScript Express middleware
✅ Python FastAPI middleware
✅ Go HTTP handlers
✅ All semantically related!
```
