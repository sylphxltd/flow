## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerabilities 🔴 → ✅ FIXED

**Files Affected:**
- `/src/tools/project-startup-tool.ts`
- `/src/targets/claude-code.ts`

**Description:**
- User input was directly concatenated into shell commands
- `execSync` and `spawn` were used without proper argument validation
- Git commands were vulnerable to injection attacks

**Fixes Implemented:**
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE - Before
const output = execSync(`git checkout -b ${branchName}`, { encoding: 'utf8' });

// ✅ SECURE - After
const result = await commandSecurity.safeExecFile('git', ['checkout', '-b', branchName], {
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  timeout: 30000,
});
```

**Security Improvements:**
- Replaced string concatenation with argument arrays
- Added command whitelist (only git commands allowed)
- Implemented input validation for all command arguments
- Added timeouts and proper error handling
- Used `execFile` instead of `execSync` with `shell: false`

### 2. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities 🟡 → ✅ FIXED

**Files Affected:**
- `/src/utils/paths.ts`
- `/src/utils/target-utils.ts`

**Description:**
- File paths were constructed without validation
- No protection against `../` directory traversal attacks
- User input could escape intended directories

**Fixes Implemented:**
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE - Before
const filePath = path.join(getRulesDir(), filename);

// ✅ SECURE - After
const filePath = pathSecurity.safeJoin(getRulesDir(), filename);

// With comprehensive validation
if (filename.includes('..') || filename.includes('/') || filename.includes('\\')) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid filename: ${filename}. Path traversal not allowed.`);
}
```

**Security Improvements:**
- Implemented `pathSecurity.safeJoin()` with traversal protection
- Added filename validation with safe character checks
- Path resolution validation to ensure files stay within allowed directories
- Sanitization of user-provided file paths

### 3. Environment Variable Security Issues 🟡 → ✅ FIXED

**Files Affected:**
- `/src/config/servers.ts`
- `/src/utils/embeddings.ts`

**Description:**
- Environment variables used without validation
- API keys and URLs not validated for proper format
- Missing validation for sensitive configuration

**Fixes Implemented:**
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE - Before
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
const baseUrl = process.env.OPENAI_BASE_URL || 'https://api.openai.com/v1';

// ✅ SECURE - After
const apiKey = envSecurity.getEnvVar('OPENAI_API_KEY');
const baseUrl = envSecurity.getEnvVar('OPENAI_BASE_URL', 'https://api.openai.com/v1');
```

**Security Improvements:**
- Created `envSecurity` utility with comprehensive validation
- Added URL validation for API endpoints
- Implemented API key format validation
- Added timeout protection for API calls
- Graceful fallback for missing or invalid environment variables

### 4. Input Validation Gaps 🟡 → ✅ FIXED

**Files Affected:**
- Multiple files with user input processing

**Description:**
- Missing input sanitization across the codebase
- Insufficient validation of user-provided data
- No centralized security framework

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive security utilities in `/src/utils/security.ts`
- Implemented Zod schemas for all input types
- Added input sanitization functions
- Created rate limiting and cryptographic utilities

## Security Framework Implementation

### Core Security Utilities

The codebase now includes a comprehensive security framework at `/src/utils/security.ts`:

#### 1. Input Validation Schemas
```typescript
export const securitySchemas = {
  projectName: z.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/),
  branchName: z.string().regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]+$/),
  filePath: z.string().refine(path => !path.includes('..')),
  commandArg: z.string().refine(arg => !/[<>|;&$`'"\\]/.test(arg)),
  url: z.string().url().refine(url => url.startsWith('https://')),
  apiKey: z.string().min(10).regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/),
};
```

#### 2. Path Security
```typescript
export const pathSecurity = {
  validatePath: (inputPath: string, allowedBase?: string) => string,
  isPathSafe: (targetPath: string, allowedBase: string) => boolean,
  safeJoin: (basePath: string, ...paths: string[]) => string,
};
```

#### 3. Command Security
```typescript
export const commandSecurity = {
  safeExecFile: (command: string, args: string[], options?: any) => Promise<any>,
  validateCommandArgs: (args: string[]) => string[],
};
```

#### 4. Environment Variable Security
```typescript
export const envSecurity = {
  validateEnvVar: (name: string, value?: string) => { name: string; value: string },
  getEnvVar: (name: string, defaultValue?: string) => string | undefined,
  validateEnvVars: (vars: Record<string, any>) => Record<string, string>,
};
```

#### 5. Input Sanitization
```typescript
export const sanitize = {
  string: (input: string, maxLength?: number) => string,
  logMessage: (input: string) => string,
  fileName: (input: string) => string,
  yamlContent: (input: string) => string,
};
```

#### 6. Cryptographic Utilities
```typescript
export const cryptoUtils = {
  generateSecureRandom: (length?: number) => string,
  generateSecureId: () => string,
  hash: (data: string) => string,
  verifyHMAC: (data: string, signature: string, secret: string) => boolean,
};
```

#### 7. Rate Limiting
```typescript
export class RateLimiter {
  constructor(maxRequests: number = 100, windowMs: number = 60000)
  isAllowed(identifier: string): boolean
  cleanup(): void
}
```
