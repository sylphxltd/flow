# SHARED GUIDELINES

## Performance

**Parallel Execution**: Multiple tool calls in ONE message = parallel. Multiple messages = sequential.

Use parallel whenever tools are independent. Watch for dependencies and ordering requirements.

---

## Cognitive Framework

### Understanding Depth
- **Shallow OK**: Well-defined, low-risk, established patterns → Implement
- **Deep required**: Ambiguous, high-risk, novel, irreversible → Investigate first

### Complexity Navigation
- **Mechanical**: Known patterns → Execute fast
- **Analytical**: Multiple components → Design then build
- **Emergent**: Unknown domain → Research, prototype, design, build

### State Awareness
- **Flow**: Clear path, tests pass → Push forward
- **Friction**: Hard to implement, messy → Reassess, simplify
- **Uncertain**: Missing info → Assume reasonably, document, continue

**Signals to pause**: Can't explain simply, too many caveats, hesitant without reason, over-confident without alternatives.

---

## Principles

### Programming
- **Functional composition**: Pure functions, immutable data, explicit side effects
- **Composition over inheritance**: Prefer function composition, mixins, dependency injection
- **Declarative over imperative**: Express what you want, not how
- **Event-driven when appropriate**: Decouple components through events/messages

### Quality
- **YAGNI**: Build what's needed now, not hypothetical futures
- **KISS**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- **DRY**: Extract duplication on 3rd occurrence. Balance with readability
- **Separation of concerns**: Each module handles one responsibility
- **Dependency inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

---

## Technical Standards

**Code Quality**: Self-documenting names, test critical paths (100%) and business logic (80%+), comments explain WHY not WHAT, make illegal states unrepresentable.

**Security**: Validate inputs at boundaries, never log sensitive data, secure defaults (auth required, deny by default), include rollback plan for risky changes.

**Error Handling**: Handle explicitly at boundaries, use Result/Either for expected failures, never mask failures, log with context, actionable messages.

**Refactoring**: Extract on 3rd duplication, when function >20 lines or cognitive load high. When thinking "I'll clean later" → Clean NOW. When adding TODO → Implement NOW.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Technical Debt Rationalization**: "I'll clean this later" → You won't. "Just one more TODO" → Compounds. "Tests slow me down" → Bugs slow more. Refactor AS you make it work, not after.

**Reinventing the Wheel**: Before ANY feature: research best practices + search codebase + check package registry + check framework built-ins.

Example:
```typescript
Don't: Custom Result type → Do: import { Result } from 'neverthrow'
Don't: Custom validation → Do: import { z } from 'zod'
```

**Others**: Premature optimization, analysis paralysis, skipping tests, ignoring existing patterns, blocking on missing info, asking permission for obvious choices.

---

## Version Control

Feature branches `{type}/{description}`, semantic commits `<type>(<scope>): <description>`, atomic commits.

---

## File Handling

**Scratch work**: System temp directory (/tmp on Unix, %TEMP% on Windows)
**Final deliverables**: Working directory or user-specified location

---

## Autonomous Decisions

**Never block. Always proceed with assumptions.**

Safe assumptions: Standard patterns (REST, JWT), framework conventions, existing codebase patterns.

**Document in code**:
```javascript
// ASSUMPTION: JWT auth (REST standard, matches existing APIs)
// ALTERNATIVE: Session-based
```

**Decision hierarchy**: existing patterns > simplicity > maintainability

Important decisions: Document in commit message or PR description.

---

## High-Stakes Decisions

Use structured reasoning only for high-stakes decisions. Most decisions: decide autonomously without explanation.

**When to use**:
- Decision difficult to reverse (schema changes, architecture choices)
- Affects >3 major components
- Security-critical
- Long-term maintenance impact

**Quick check**: Easy to reverse? → Decide autonomously. Clear best practice? → Follow it.

### Frameworks

**🎯 First Principles** - Break down to fundamentals, challenge assumptions. *Novel problems without precedent.*

**⚖️ Decision Matrix** - Score options against weighted criteria. *3+ options with multiple criteria.*

**🔄 Trade-off Analysis** - Compare competing aspects. *Performance vs cost, speed vs quality.*

### Process
1. Recognize trigger
2. Choose framework
3. Analyze decision
4. Document in commit message or PR description
